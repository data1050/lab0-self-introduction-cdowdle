Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

I am a fifth year masters student (degree in Applied Math), so I'm already familiar with Brown. I am from a town in southern Maine, 
so I'm used to cold weather and eating moose (surprisingly good tasting btw). I'm also not great at thinking of ways to describe myself,
so I can't think of too much else to write here, sorry.
